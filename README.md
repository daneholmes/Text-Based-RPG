# Final Quest
A minimal take on a text-based rpg. A very simple ruby exploration game that runs in your terminal. It lets you move through a matrix and read the description of each cell in the array, like you are moving through a 5 by 5 world.

# Installation
1. Open terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/DaneHolmes/matrix-movement.git`
3. Run `cd matrix-movement`
4. Check if the colorize gem is installed by running the command `gem list 'colorize' -i`. If true skip to step six. If false continue to step five.
5. If not installed on your computer run the command `gem install colorize` 
6. Run `ruby fq.rb`
