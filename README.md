# Tiny Ruby Text-Based RPG
A minimal take on a text-based RPG. A very simple ruby exploration game that runs in your terminal. It lets you move through a matrix and read the description of each cell in the array like you are moving through a 5 by 5 world. This is a work in progress and it is easily expandable. I will probably add battles and things to do in the areas next.

# Installation
1. Open terminal
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/daneholmes/Text-Based-RPG.git`
3. Run `cd Text-Based-RPG`
4. Check if the colorize gem is installed by running the command `gem list 'colorize' -i`. If true skip to step six. If false continue to step five.
5. If not installed on your computer run the command `gem install colorize` 
6. Run `ruby run.rb`
